# Task-Management-Software
Task management is the process of managing a task through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing, tracking and reporting. Task management can help either individuals achieve goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the accomplishment of collective goals. Tasks are also differentiated by complexity, from low to high.
Effective task management requires managing all aspects of a task, including its status, priority, time, notifications and so on. These can be lumped together broadly into the basic activities of task management.
Managing multiple individual or team tasks may require specialised software, for example workflow or project management software. In fact, many people believe that task management should serve as a foundation for project management activities.

Project managers adhering to task-oriented management have a detailed and up-to-date project schedule, and are usually good at directing team members and moving the project forward.

# Purpose	

 * **Problems Faced by the manual system** :
The success of any project depends on the coordination between the team apart from the technical skills. It is often observed in the service sector that due to miscommunication and lack of co-ordination, important notices do not reach people, projects are delayed, deadlines are past and customer dissatisfaction arises. 

 * Hence, a need for an automated system arises wherein a company can have its own network from which projects can be assigned separately .Teams are divided project wise and tasks can be distributed amongst them. Any notice regarding the projects can be broadcasted to the whole team.  The elaborate timeline of each task can be viewed, giving complete information about the taskâ€™s lifecycle. The whole team is alerted when any deadline approaches. 

 * To overcome the problems faced in the current manual system, The Task Management Software has been proposed.
